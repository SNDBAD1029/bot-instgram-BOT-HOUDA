# Random Joke Generator

A minimal Node.js + Express app that fetches random jokes from external APIs and exposes a small web UI.

Features
- Server endpoint: GET /api/joke?source=icanhaz|official
- Default source: icanhazdadjoke (short dad jokes)
- Fallback to Official Joke API if primary fails
- Small browser UI to fetch and copy jokes

Quick start
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install

2. Start:
   npm start

3. Open in browser:
   http://localhost:3000

Notes
- The server proxies requests to the external APIs to avoid CORS issues and to keep API keys / headers server-side.
- To extend: add caching, user favorites, rate-limiting, more providers.
